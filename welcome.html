        <p><strong>Who We Are</strong><br>Nielsen, Zehe &#38 Antas, P.C. was established in 1997 when its founding partners left a large National insurance litigation law firm. The creation of Nielsen, Zehe &#38 Antas, P.C. was strategic and done specifically
          to better serve its clients and solve their problems. We therefore view ourselves as problem solvers. Whatever our clients’ problems are, we have the ability, experience, reputation, and commitment to solve them-quickly, efficiently, and cost
          effectively.
        </p>
        <p> Based in Chicago, centrally located in the United States, Nielsen, Zehe &#38 Antas, P.C. has been a nationally recognized firm practicing in forty-eight states specializing in complex litigation and high risk lawsuits since its founding. Through
          the years, the firm’s recognized problem solving experience has led to its expansion into the business and corporate law fields as well. As trial lawyers, our attorneys have the skill and experience to step into a court room, and to effectively
          and efficiently represent our clients. Many Nielsen, Zehe &#38 Antas, P.C. attorneys have individually tried more cases in court than most law firms.</p>
        <p>The firm’s balanced plaintiff-defense practice has enable it to “see both sides of the fence” to better represent its clients in court, mediation, arbitration, or at a business closing. Through the years, the firm’s broad experience has allowed
          it to develop expertise in representing its clients in commercial, business transaction, insurance defense, construction defect, product liability, professional liability, labor and employment, subrogation-third party recovery (both property and
          workers compensation), unfair business practice, and insurance coverage disputes. Again, our philosophy and experience are dedicated to solving our clients problems efficiently, cost effectively, and quickly.</p>
        <p>At Nielsen, Zehe &#38 Antas, P.C., it all starts with being trial lawyers. We do not claim to be trial lawyers – we actually try cases and deliver results. Our focus on timely reporting, problem solving, and taking a “business approach” to all of
          our clients cases has allowed Nielsen, Zehe &#38 Antas, P.C. to achieve the National stature and reputation it has developed.</p>
        <p><strong>Mission Statement And Core Values</strong><br>At Nielsen, Zehe &#38 Antas, P.C., we are committed to our core values of integrity, honesty, excellence, teamwork, and putting our client’s interests first. Since our firm was built on the strategic
          foundation of better serving our clients, our core values and strategic goals as a law firm allow us to partner with our clients, solve their problems, and meet their goals.</p>
